# An Exploratory Data Analysis Of The 2011-2020 Hugo Nominations Data  

For a class stats project I examined Hugo Award nominations over the past 11 years.

## Disclaimers
- The data entry was done by hand, as such it is possible that there is an error in the data set
- I pruned nominations with multiple authors from my data set because it would violate my assumption of one set of pronouns per nomination
- I want to make it very clear that **I am glad that the Hugo Awards have recently been more conscious about gender equity.** 

## About This Project 
- My data source was [the hugo awards website](http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/)
    - To ascertain an author's pronouns, I looked through an author's twitter, Wikipedia page, or website. 
    - **Nominations with multiple authors were excluded because it would violate my assumption of one set of pronouns per nomination.**
    - I only looked at the following categories because finding an author's pronouns is labor intensive so I had to limit the scope of the project 
        - Best Novel
        - Best Novella
        - Best Novelette
    - Each category yielded ~66 observational units.
- I used Python to do some minimal data processing and R for data viz
